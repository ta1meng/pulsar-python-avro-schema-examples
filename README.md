# pulsar-python-avro-schema-examples
Demonstrates Pulsar's Avro schema support using the Python client library, including bug fixes and enhancements.

Diff definition.py and schema.py in the schema_fixes directory to see the fixes and enhancements made for the Python Pulsar client library 2.7.1 for Python 3.7.

Copy and paste these files into the Python Pulsar client library, and all code examples should work. 

I'm using a Mac, and then pasted my modified files into (note: backup existing files first):

```
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pulsar/schema
```

All examples were tested against Pulsar 2.7.1 using the Pulsar Python client library version 2.7.1, installed under Python 3.7.

The fixes and enhancements should work against Python 2.7 as well, however I did not test this theory.
